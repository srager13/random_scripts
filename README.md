These are very short file descriptions:

sort_CVs.py:
  Script written to sort a bunch of resumes that were in a local folder into subdirectories.
  It works by opening a pdf, checking if a keyword exists in the document and copying it to a 
  particulare folder if it does.  

plot_queue_errors.py:
  Script to parse and plot data of queue errors in ns-3 simulations run with the distributed backpressure protocol.

fitness_center_occupancy.py:
  Script to scrape PSU's fitness center website to collect occupancy data at the various rec centers/gyms.

barwitherr.m:
	Library file downloaded from mathworks that will create a bar graph with error bars.

labeled_scatter.m:
	Plot script that creates a scatter plot with values at each index intersection (like a grid).  Each plotted value is inside a circle whose size depends on the value being inserted and includes a label of the actual value. 

plot_scatter.m:
	Scatter plot that places many rows on the same graph.  This allows for many y-values for each x-value, letting you show heavily trafficed areas, for example.  

three_d_bar_plot.m:
	As the name suggests, this script creates a 3-dimensional bar graph.
